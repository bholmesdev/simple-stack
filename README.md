# Simple Stack 🌱

A collection of tools I've built to make JS app development simpler. To be honest, there isn't a "story" connecting these packages together (I'm no TanStack). But they follow a common theme: solve a simple use case without too many features.

## Packages

Simple Stack has a few actively maintained packages:

## Simple Store

Simple Store is a reactive store that combines the simplicity of signals with the power of "selectors" you'd find in Zustand or Redux.

- Documentation: [simple-stack.dev/store](https://simple-stack.dev/store)

## Simple Scope

Simple Scope is a vite plugin that generates scoped IDs for any file you're in. Perfect for form label IDs and query selectors.
