A collection of tools I've built to **make web development simpler.**

To be honest, there isn't a "story" connecting these packages together (I'm no TanStack). But they follow a common theme: solve a simple use case without too many features.

import { CardGrid, Card, LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<CardGrid>
	<Card href="/store" title="Simple Store" icon="document">
		A reactive store that combines the simplicity of signals with the power of "selectors" you'd find in Zustand.

		<LinkCard href="/store" title="Documentation" />
	</Card>

	<Card href="/scope" title="Simple Scope" icon="magnifier">
		A vite plugin that generates scoped IDs for any file you're in. Perfect for form label IDs and query selectors.

		<LinkCard href="/scope" title="Documentation" />
	</Card>

	<Card href="/query" title="Simple Query" icon="puzzle">
		A simple way to add JS scripts to Astro components.

		<LinkCard href="/query" title="Documentation" />
	</Card>

</CardGrid>
