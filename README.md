# Simple Stack 🌱

A collection of tools I've built to make JS app development simpler. To be honest, there isn't a "story" connecting these packages together (I'm no TanStack). But they follow a common theme: solve a simple use case without too many features.

## Packages

Simple Stack has a few actively maintained packages:

- **[Simple scope](https://simple-stack.dev/scope):** A scoped ID generator for any file you're in. Perfect for form label IDs and query selectors.
- **[Simple query](https://simple-stack.dev/query):** A simple way to add JS scripts to Astro components.
