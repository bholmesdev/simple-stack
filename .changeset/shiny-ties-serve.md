"simple-stack-form": patch
---

Add a generic React template to use simple-form in non-Astro projects.

To try it, install `simple-stack-form` as a dependency in your React-based project:

```bash
# pnpm
pnpm i simple-stack-form
# npm
npm i simple-stack-form
```

And run the `simple-form create` command. This will create a base template for validation, and leave `onSubmit` handling to you.

```bash
# pnpm
pnpx run simple-form create
# npm
npx simple-form create
```
